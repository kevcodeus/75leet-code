# Problem: 1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings

## Problem Statement
For two strings `s` and `t`, we say "t divides s" if and only if `s = t + t + t + ... + t` (i.e., `t` is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the largest string `x` such that `x` divides both `str1` and `str2`.

### Example 1:
Input: `str1 = "ABCABC"`, `str2 = "ABC"`  
Output: `"ABC"`

### Example 2:
Input: `str1 = "ABABAB"`, `str2 = "ABAB"`  
Output: `"AB"`

### Example 3:
Input: `str1 = "LEET"`, `str2 = "CODE"`  
Output: `""`

## Approach 1

### Logic of the Solution
1. Ensure `str1` is the longer string; if not, swap them.
2. If the two strings are equal, return one of them as they are the GCD.
3. If concatenating the strings in different orders does not yield the same result, return an empty string as no common divisor string exists.
4. Recursively find the GCD by slicing `str1` with the length of `str2`.

### Code Explanation
1. **Swapping strings**: The condition `if str2 > str1` ensures `str1` is always the longer string.
2. **Equality check**: If `str1` and `str2` are equal, we return either of them as the GCD.
3. **Concatenation check**: The condition `if str1 + str2 != str2 + str1` checks if concatenating the strings in different orders yields the same result. If not, there is no common divisor string.
4. **Recursive call**: The line `return self.gcdOfStrings(str1[len(str2):], str2)` makes a recursive call to find the GCD of the sliced string `str1` and `str2`.

## Approach 2

### Logic of the Solution
1. Ensure `str1` is the longer string; if not, swap them.
2. If the two strings are equal, return one of them as they are the GCD.
3. If the prefix of `str1` with the length of `str2` does not match `str2`, return an empty string.
4. Recursively find the GCD by slicing `str1` with the length of `str2`.


### Code Explanation
1. **Swapping strings**: The condition `if str2 > str1` ensures `str1` is always the longer string.
2. **Equality check**: If `str1` and `str2` are equal, we return either of them as the GCD.
3. **Prefix check**: The condition `if str1[:len(str2)] != str2` checks if the prefix of `str1` with the length of `str2` matches `str2`. If not, there is no common divisor string.
4. **Recursive call**: The line `return self.gcdOfStrings(str1[len(str2):], str2)` makes a recursive call to find the GCD of the sliced string `str1` and `str2`.
