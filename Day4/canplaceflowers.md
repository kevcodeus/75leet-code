# Day 4: Can Place Flowers

## Problem Description

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and `false` otherwise.

## Example 1:
- **Input**: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
- **Output**: true

## Example 2:
- **Input**: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
- **Output**: false

## Approach

### Step-by-Step Explanation

### Step 1: Initialize Variables
We initialize two variables:
- `left` to -2 to handle the start of the flowerbed.
- `right` to 0 to iterate through the flowerbed.

```python
left, right = -2, 0
```

### Step 2: Iterate Through the Flowerbed
We iterate through the flowerbed using the `right` index:
- For each 1 encountered, calculate the potential places for flowers between the last 1 (`left`) and the current 1 (`right`).
- Update `left` to `right` after each 1.

```python
while n > 0 and right < len(bed):
    if bed[right] == 1:
        n -= (right-left-2)//2
        left = right
    right += 1
```

### Step 3: Final Check
After the loop, if the last plot is empty, check the remaining spots for placing flowers.

```python
if bed[-1] == 0 and right == len(bed):
    n -= (right-left-1)//2
```

### Step 4: Return Result
Return true if `n` is less than or equal to 0, meaning all flowers can be planted; otherwise, return false.

```python
return n <= 0
```

### Full Solution

Here is the complete solution code:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, bed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        left, right = -2, 0
        
        while n > 0 and right < len(bed):
            if bed[right] == 1:
                n -= (right-left-2)//2
                left = right
            right += 1
        if bed[-1] == 0 and right == len(bed):
            n -= (right-left-1)//2
        return n <= 0

# Example usage:
flowerbed = list(map(int, input("Enter the flowerbed: ").split()))
n = int(input("Enter the number of new flowers to plant: "))
solution = Solution()
print(solution.canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed, n))
```

## Explanation of the Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**: 
   - `left` is set to -2 to account for the initial boundary condition.
   - `right` is used to traverse the flowerbed.
2. **Iterate Through Flowerbed**:
   - As we encounter each flower (`1`), we calculate how many flowers can be placed between `left` and `right` using the formula `(right-left-2)//2`.
   - We then update `left` to `right`.
3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, if the last position is empty, we check for the remaining possible positions.
4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, we check if `n` is less than or equal to zero to determine if all flowers can be planted without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

This method ensures an efficient way to determine the maximum number of flowers that can be planted while adhering to the given constraints.
