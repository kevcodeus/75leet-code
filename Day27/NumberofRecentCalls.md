# Number of Recent Calls (LeetCode 933)

## Problem Description

You have a `RecentCounter` class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.

### Class Methods

- `RecentCounter()`: Initializes the counter with zero recent requests.
- `ping(int t) -> int`: Adds a new request at time `t` (milliseconds) and returns the number of requests that have happened in the past 3000 milliseconds (including the new request). Specifically, it returns the number of requests that have happened in the inclusive range `[t - 3000, t]`.

### Example

```python
# Input
["RecentCounter", "ping", "ping", "ping", "ping"]
[[], [1], [100], [3001], [3002]]

# Output
[null, 1, 2, 3, 3]

# Explanation
recentCounter = RecentCounter()
recentCounter.ping(1)     # requests = [1], range is [-2999,1], return 1
recentCounter.ping(100)   # requests = [1, 100], range is [-2900,100], return 2
recentCounter.ping(3001)  # requests = [1, 100, 3001], range is [1,3001], return 3
recentCounter.ping(3002)  # requests = [1, 100, 3001, 3002], range is [2,3002], return 3
```

## Solution

This solution implements the `RecentCounter` class using Python. The `ping` method utilizes a set to efficiently manage the timestamps of requests. For each new request, the method calculates the valid range of timestamps within the past 3000 milliseconds and determines how many requests fall within that range.

### Python Code

```python
class RecentCounter:

    def __init__(self):
        self.li = set()

    def ping(self, t: int) -> int:
        self.li.add(t)
        c = set(range(t-3000, t+1))
        return len(self.li & c)
```

### Key Points

- **Efficiency**: The solution uses a set to store and manage timestamps, which allows for efficient calculation of recent requests using set intersection.
- **Edge Cases**: The solution handles cases where timestamps fall outside the 3000-millisecond window by ensuring only the relevant range is considered for each ping.

## How to Use

To run the code, simply copy the `RecentCounter` class into your Python environment. You can instantiate the class and call the `ping` method with various timestamps to see how it counts recent requests.

```python
# Example usage
recentCounter = RecentCounter()
print(recentCounter.ping(1))     # Output: 1
print(recentCounter.ping(100))   # Output: 2
print(recentCounter.ping(3001))  # Output: 3
print(recentCounter.ping(3002))  # Output: 3
```
